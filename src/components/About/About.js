                            <p style={{ fontSize: "16px", color: "black" }}>A new data tool was introduced in Shopee. Before this tool was launched, PMs had a heavy reliance on the Business Intelligence team to perform A/B testing and performance monitoring of the product. When the metrics were needed by the team, they had to contact the BI in charge for the product to send the reports over, even if a similar request was completed previously. I was resolute to fix the gaps between this inefficiency as I built a monitoring system that can be customised based on the PM's requirements to measure certain metrics and obtain data to measure performance of the product. Working with the BI team, I learnt to pick up the new system and also held training sessions for PMs on how to use the new tool for performance tracking of the product.</p>

                          <p style={{ fontSize: "16px", color: "black" }}>Before this project was completed, PMs in the team usually have to manually use word/google slides/preview to present the mockup of the new feature to be implemented on the system when drafting the BRDs and PRDs. This process was inefficient as it is tedious to manually edit the screenshots of the current product to add the new feature without the help of the design team. To streamline the BRD and PRD drafting process, I created a single Figma file with all the pages and component guide so that PMs can easily copy the page needed and add the required buttons/input fields etc. After the internship, I have received feedback that the Figma file makes it easier for PMs to draft the screenshots for new features in the BRDs/PRDs.</p>
